### Hi, I'm Bulat 👨🏻‍💻

Currently I'm working on developing and maintaining ELT pipelines for e-commerce department of multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation as part of a Data Engineering Team. Also have a passion on web development, both - front and back end parts. Have decent experience writing web scrapers, telegram bots, various cli automation tools. In some spare time I developing online boardgame called [Rummikub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummikub) with slightly altered ruleset (which we are used to while playing with friends offline). You can inspect the source code of it [here](https://github.com/ilov3/rummikub) and try to play it with friends on [rummi.uk](https://rummi.uk)

For fun, I like to spend time with my family and friends, go on a trip, exploring new locations and beautiful places.
